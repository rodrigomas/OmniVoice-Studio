# OmniVoice Studio — Install Troubleshooting

The top 10 errors users have actually hit on `v0.2.x`, with their causes and
fixes. Most have a deeplink anchor that the in-app error UI's "Open docs for
this error" button targets directly.

## Start here: self-diagnosis

<a id="self-diagnosis"></a>

Before digging through the entries below, let the app diagnose itself:

- **In the app:** **Settings → About → "Run self-check"** verifies your
  compute device (CUDA/MPS/CPU), ffmpeg, HuggingFace token, disk space,
  data-directory permissions, RAM, installed TTS engines, and hub
  reachability — each with a hint when something's off.
- **Headless / terminal:**

  ```bash
  uv run python backend/main.py --diagnose          # same checks, exits 1 on failure
  uv run python backend/main.py --diagnose --deep   # also loads the active engine
                                                    # and synthesizes a test utterance
  ```

  `--deep` catches "installed but broken" engines. On a fresh install it may
  cold-load the model (minutes, plus a large download).

- **Filing an issue?** **Settings → About → "Save diagnostic bundle"**
  produces a zip (self-check report, recent classified errors, scrubbed log
  tails) you can drag straight onto the GitHub issue. Home paths and
  anything token-shaped are redacted before they leave your machine.

## 1. `pkg_resources` missing (ModuleNotFoundError)

<a id="pkg_resources-missing"></a>

**Symptom:** the splash screen shows `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
'pkg_resources'` during WhisperX import, and the app never advances past the
"Setting up models" step.

**Cause:** WhisperX (and a couple of its transitive deps) still imports
`pkg_resources`, which `setuptools >= 80` dropped. `pyproject.toml` pins
`setuptools>=75,<80` so it stays present — but the venv can still lose it two
other ways: **(a)** antivirus (commonly Windows Defender) quarantines
`pkg_resources`' files, or **(b)** a partial/interrupted extract. In both cases
setuptools' *metadata* remains, so `uv`/`pip` report it "already satisfied" and
a plain install **no-ops** — the files are never restored.

**Fix:** in the backend venv, **force a reinstall** (a plain install won't work
for the reasons above):

```
uv pip install --reinstall 'setuptools>=75,<80'
```

then restart. If it recurs, your antivirus is removing the files again — add the
backend **`.venv`** folder to its exclusions (Windows Security → Virus & threat
protection → Exclusions). The app's auto-repair now uses `--reinstall` too, so a
fresh install heals itself.

## 2. HF 401 / pyannote license not accepted

**Symptom:** dubbing fails with `HfHubHTTPError: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized
for url …pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1…`, or
diarization silently falls back to a single speaker.

**Cause:** `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1` is a **gated** model — even with a
valid HF token, you need to accept the model's license on its HuggingFace page
before the token works for downloads.

**Fix:**

1. Open **Settings → API Keys** in the app and paste a working HF token (or set
   `HF_TOKEN` in your env). See [docs/setup/huggingface-token.md](../setup/huggingface-token.md).
2. Visit https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1 while signed
   in with the same HF account → click **"Agree and access repository"**.
3. Retry the job. The token state in **Settings → API Keys** should now show
   the "App" row with a green check next to your username.

## 3. Gatekeeper quarantine on macOS

**Symptom:** "OmniVoice Studio.app is damaged and can't be opened."

**Cause:** the app is not yet notarised (signing is wired in `release.yml` and
activates once the maintainer adds the Apple cert secrets) — until then macOS
quarantines every download.

**Fix:** see [macos.md#gatekeeper-quarantine](macos.md#gatekeeper-quarantine).

## 4. AppImage white screen on Fedora 44 / Ubuntu 24.04

**Symptom:** the AppImage window opens fully white. No UI ever appears.

**Cause:** WebKitGTK 2.44 / 2.46 compositing-mode regression.

**Fix:** see [linux.md#appimage-white-screen-on-fedora-44--ubuntu-2404](linux.md#appimage-white-screen-on-fedora-44--ubuntu-2404).

## 5. Windows Triton / torch.compile OOM

**Symptom:** the first synthesis call fails with `OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out
of memory` or `RuntimeError: Triton compilation failed`, especially on
<16 GB VRAM GPUs.

**Cause:** the engine's `torch.compile` step compiles Triton kernels with a
peak memory footprint that exceeds free VRAM. Windows-only quirk.

**Fix:** see [windows.md#torch-compile-oom](windows.md#torch-compile-oom).

**Linked issue:** [#65](https://github.com/debpalash/OmniVoice-Studio/issues/65)

## 6. `uv venv` Python download fails (restricted network)

**Symptom:** during first launch, `uv` exits with a network error pulling
`python-build-standalone` from GitHub. Common in China, intermittently in
Russia, sometimes on corporate proxies.

**Fix:** see [linux.md#restricted-networks-china--russia](linux.md#restricted-networks-china--russia)
(same env vars work on macOS and Windows — `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR`,
`UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT=120`, `UV_HTTP_RETRIES=5`, `UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE=only-system`).

[#60](https://github.com/debpalash/OmniVoice-Studio/issues/60).

## 7. `.deb` ffprobe path conflict on upgrade

**Symptom:** after upgrading from a pre-v0.3 .deb, `ffprobe -version` reports
"OmniVoice bundled ffprobe" instead of the system ffmpeg, breaking other apps
that rely on `/usr/bin/ffprobe`.

**Fix:** see [linux.md#deb-ffprobe-conflict](linux.md#deb-ffprobe-conflict).

## 8. Docker LAN access — media preview 404

**Symptom:** OmniVoice loads on `http://<lan-ip>:3900` but the audio preview
pane shows 404s for `/media/...`.

**Cause:** pre-v0.3, the frontend hardcoded `localhost:3900` for media-preview
URLs, which is wrong when the UI is reached from a different LAN host.

**Fix:** the frontend derives its API/media base from the page's own origin.
When running behind a reverse proxy where the UI and API are on different
origins, set the runtime override `OMNIVOICE_PUBLIC_API_BASE` (works on the
prebuilt image via `docker run -e`) — see
[docker.md#lan-access](docker.md#lan-access).

## 9. Apple Silicon `mlx-whisper` unavailable on Intel mac

**Symptom:** on an Intel mac, OmniVoice logs `mlx-whisper backend unavailable;
falling back to faster-whisper`.

**Cause:** `mlx-whisper` and `mlx-audio` only build for arm64 (Apple Silicon).

**Fix:** none needed — `faster-whisper` (CTranslate2) is the supported Intel
path and is still fast. If you want the latest CT2 wheels, run `uv sync`
from a fresh source checkout.

## 10. Windows: `Could not locate cudnn_ops_infer64_8.dll` during transcription

**Symptom:** on Windows + NVIDIA, transcription/dubbing fails and the backend
log shows `Could not locate cudnn_ops_infer64_8.dll`. Settings → Models shows
WhisperX or faster-whisper selected.

**Cause:** WhisperX and faster-whisper run on **CTranslate2**, which needs
**cuDNN 8**, but PyTorch 2.8 ships cuDNN 9. OmniVoice side-loads a cuDNN-8 copy
from `.venv\Lib\site-packages\cudnn8_compat\`; if that folder is missing
(some upgrade paths don't install it), CTranslate2 can't find the DLL.

**Fix:** switch the ASR backend to **PyTorch Whisper** in **Settings → Models**.
It runs on PyTorch's own stack (cuDNN 9, bundled with torch) and needs no
cuDNN-8 DLL — it loads its Whisper pipeline on demand (no extra env var). To
keep using faster-whisper/WhisperX instead, reinstall to restore the bundled
`cudnn8_compat` libraries.

## 11. IndexTTS / CosyVoice / ChatterboxTTS clash

**Symptom:** installing one of these engines breaks the others — e.g. after
installing CosyVoice, IndexTTS errors out with import conflicts.

**Cause:** these engines pin incompatible transformer / torch versions inside
their own engine venvs. Pre-v0.3 they shared a single venv.

**Fix:** Phase 2 ships subprocess isolation per engine (each engine runs in
its own venv). For v0.3, workaround: install only one of the conflicting
engines per OmniVoice copy. See [docs/engines/cosyvoice.md](../engines/cosyvoice.md)
for the dedicated CosyVoice path.

## First-run setup fails on a restricted network (GitHub/PyPI blocked)

On networks that block or can't resolve **GitHub**, the first-run bootstrap may
fail to download the managed Python (`uv venv ... failed`, often a DNS error).
OmniVoice now tries, in order: the default GitHub host → a gh-proxy mirror → your
**system Python** (if 3.11+ is installed). If all three fail:

1. **Install Python 3.11+** from <https://www.python.org/downloads/> (on Windows,
   tick *"Add Python to PATH"*), then relaunch — OmniVoice will use it.
2. **Point at a reachable mirror** for the Python download:
   - `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR=https://gh-proxy.com/https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download`
3. **Point at a PyPI mirror** for the dependency install (`uv sync`):
   - China: `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX=https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple` (or `https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple`)
   - Fully-blocked networks (e.g. some regions): use a VPN — there is no
     government-blessed PyPI mirror to rely on.
4. The bootstrap already raises the network budget for you
   (`UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT=120`, `UV_HTTP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=30`, `UV_HTTP_RETRIES=5`);
   you can raise them further in the environment if a mirror is very slow.
