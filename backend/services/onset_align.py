"""
Speech-onset alignment for transcript segments (issue #280, item 1).

Whisper-family ASR models are prone to stretching a segment's *start* back
over leading non-speech (intro music, room tone, silence). The classic
symptom from the issue report: the speaker starts talking at 0:02–0:03,
but the first transcript segment says ``start=0.0`` — so the dubbed line
plays the moment the video begins and everything feels desynchronised.

``snap_segment_starts`` post-processes segments against the actual audio
(ideally the Demucs-isolated vocals track, which the dub pipeline already
produces): for each segment it scans the waveform inside ``[start, end]``
for the first frame whose RMS rises above an adaptive threshold and moves
``start`` forward to just before that onset.

Design constraints:

* **Forward-only.** A segment start is never moved earlier — that could
  collide with the previous speaker. We only trim leading non-speech.
* **Conservative.** Shifts below ``min_shift_s`` are ignored (word-level
  timestamps are usually within ~100 ms already); a minimum segment
  duration is always preserved; segments whose window looks silent
  (no frame above the absolute floor) are left untouched.
* **Pure NumPy.** No model, no platform-specific code — identical
  behaviour on macOS / Windows / Linux, trivially unit-testable.
